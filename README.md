## Introduction
This project is a web-based grid simulation where each cell within a grid can be either red or blue. The grid evolves over time according to specific rules, updating the color of each cell based on the states of its neighbors.

### Features
- Randomly generated grid of customizable size.
- Cells change color based on the number of neighboring cells.
- Efficient rendering and state management for improved performance.


## Usage

To run the grid simulation:

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. The grid will automatically start evolving. The evolution rules are applied every 10 ms, updating the grid's state.
